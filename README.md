Here is a nutrition tracking app that I made using Java. In order to make it run, open up Eclipse on your computer then create a new project and then put all the java files in there.
For the comma-seperated value file, you can move it to just outside the source (src) directory.
Feel free to download and start tracking your nutrition!
